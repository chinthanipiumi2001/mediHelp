    <h2>Tinea, Gingivitis, and Candidiasis</h2>
    <p>Tinea, gingivitis, and candidiasis are different medical conditions affecting different parts of the body, but they share a common factor: they are caused by fungal infections.</p>

    <h3>Tinea (Ringworm):</h3>
    <p>Tinea, commonly known as ringworm, is a fungal infection that can affect the skin, scalp, or nails. It appears as red, scaly patches that may itch or cause hair loss. Tinea can spread through direct contact with an infected person or animal, or by sharing contaminated objects such as towels or clothing.</p>

    <h3>Gingivitis:</h3>
    <p>Gingivitis is a mild form of gum disease caused by the buildup of plaque on the teeth. It is characterized by red, swollen gums that may bleed during brushing or flossing. Gingivitis is usually reversible with good oral hygiene practices, such as regular brushing, flossing, and dental cleanings.</p>

    <h3>Candidiasis:</h3>
    <p>Candidiasis, also known as a yeast infection, is caused by an overgrowth of the Candida fungus. It can affect various parts of the body, including the mouth (oral thrush), throat, esophagus, skin, and genitals. Symptoms may include white patches in the mouth or throat, redness and itching in the genital area, or creamy white patches on the skin.</p>

    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <p>Treatment for tinea, gingivitis, and candidiasis may vary depending on the severity and location of the infection. Common treatment options include antifungal medications, topical creams or ointments, oral medications, and good hygiene practices.</p>
