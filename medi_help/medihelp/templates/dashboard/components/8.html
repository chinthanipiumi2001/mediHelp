    <h2>Seborrheic Keratoses</h2>
    <p>Seborrheic keratoses are common non-cancerous skin growths that often appear as wart-like, brown, black, or tan growths on the surface of the skin. They are usually harmless and can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Seborrheic keratoses typically develop in middle-aged or older adults and can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly found on the chest, back, shoulders, and face.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Raised, wart-like growths</li>
        <li>Flat or slightly elevated lesions</li>
        <li>Variety of colors including brown, black, tan, or white</li>
        <li>Can have a waxy, stuck-on appearance</li>
        <li>Often have a rough or scaly texture</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <p>The exact cause of seborrheic keratoses is not fully understood, but they are thought to be related to aging and sun exposure. They may also have a genetic component, as they tend to run in families.</p>

    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <p>Seborrheic keratoses typically do not require treatment unless they become irritated, itchy, or cosmetically undesirable. Treatment options may include cryotherapy (freezing), curettage (scraping), or electrocautery (burning). In some cases, topical medications may be prescribed to help reduce the appearance of seborrheic keratoses.</p>

    <h3>Prevention:</h3>
    <p>Since seborrheic keratoses are thought to be largely influenced by genetics and aging, there are no specific prevention measures. However, protecting the skin from excessive sun exposure may help reduce the risk of developing additional growths and prevent existing ones from becoming irritated.</p>
