    <h3>Sun Protection:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days.</li>
        <li>Wear protective clothing, such as wide-brimmed hats and sunglasses, when outdoors.</li>
        <li>Avoid prolonged sun exposure, especially during peak hours (10 am - 4 pm).</li>
        <li>Seek shade whenever possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Cleanse your skin gently with a mild cleanser, and moisturize regularly.</li>
        <li>Avoid harsh soaps and hot water, as they can strip the skin of natural oils.</li>
        <li>Use non-comedogenic skincare products to prevent clogged pores and acne.</li>

        <li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption, as they can contribute to premature aging and skin damage.</li>
        <li>Get regular exercise to improve circulation and promote healthy skin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Regular Check-ups:</h3>
    <ul>
