    <h2>Warts and Molluscum</h2>
    <p>Warts and molluscum contagiosum are both common skin conditions caused by viral infections.</p>

    <h3>Warts:</h3>
    <p>Warts are small, rough growths that can appear on any part of the body. They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and can spread through direct contact. There are several types of warts, including common warts, plantar warts (on the soles of the feet), and genital warts.</p>

    <h3>Molluscum Contagiosum:</h3>
    <p>Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection characterized by small, round bumps with a dimpled center. It is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) and is most commonly seen in children, although it can affect people of any age. Molluscum contagiosum is spread through direct contact with an infected person or contaminated objects.</p>

    </ul>
