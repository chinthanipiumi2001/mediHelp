    <h2>Benign Keratosis</h2>
    <p>Benign keratosis, also known as seborrheic keratosis or senile wart, is a non-cancerous skin growth that appears as a waxy, wart-like lesion. It is typically found in older adults and is more common in individuals with fair skin. Benign keratosis is usually harmless and does not require treatment unless it becomes symptomatic or cosmetically bothersome.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Waxy, wart-like growth</li>
        <li>Brown, black, or tan coloration</li>
        <li>Raised or flat lesion</li>
        <li>Irregular surface texture</li>
        <li>May be single or clustered</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <p>The exact cause of benign keratosis is unknown, but it is believed to be related to aging and sun exposure. Genetic factors may also play a role in its development.</p>

    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <p>Benign keratosis typically does not require treatment unless it causes symptoms such as itching, irritation, or bleeding. If treatment is desired for cosmetic reasons or if the lesion is symptomatic, options may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cryotherapy (freezing)</li>
        <li>Electrosurgery (burning)</li>
        <li>Curettage (scraping)</li>
        <li>Topical medications (e.g., retinoids)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prevention:</h3>
    <p>Since benign keratosis is largely associated with aging and sun exposure, prevention strategies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular use of sunscreen</li>
        <li>Wearing protective clothing and hats</li>
        <li>Avoiding prolonged sun exposure</li>
        <li>Regular skin examinations for early detection</li>
    </ul>
